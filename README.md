Business Case Study: Predictive Absenteeism Analysis for Improved Workforce Productivity
Introduction: In today's highly competitive business environment, organizations face increased pressure to achieve unattainable goals, leading to elevated stress levels among employees. The persistent presence of these factors may adversely impact an individual's health, potentially resulting in minor illnesses or even long-term conditions such as depression. Recognizing the importance of maintaining a healthy and productive workforce, our focus is on predicting absenteeism from work, specifically understanding whether an employee is likely to be absent for a certain number of hours during a workday.

Objective: The primary objective is to leverage predictive analytics to anticipate employee absenteeism. By doing so, we aim to empower decision-makers with valuable insights into workforce availability, enabling proactive adjustments to the work process. The goal is to mitigate productivity gaps and enhance the overall quality of work generated within the organization.

Defining Absenteeism: "The absence from work during normal working hours, resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular working activity."

Key Questions to Address:

Data Source and Information: What information should be considered for predicting absenteeism? Should the focus be on predicting excessive absenteeism?

Measurement of Absenteeism: How will absenteeism be measured, and what parameters will be used to determine excessive absenteeism?

Approach: Our analysis will focus on exploring the relationship between specific employee characteristics and the likelihood of being absent from work. Questions such as the distance an employee lives from their workplace, the number of dependents (children and pets), educational background, and other relevant factors will be considered. By understanding these associations, we aim to predict the number of working hours an employee could potentially be away from work.

Utilizing Machine Learning: To achieve our predictive goals, we will employ machine learning techniques, including logistic regression and other classification models. These models will be trained on historical data to identify patterns and make predictions about future absenteeism. The model with the highest performance, determined through rigorous evaluation metrics, will be selected for implementation.

Expected Outcomes:

Proactive Workforce Management: Anticipating absenteeism allows for strategic workforce planning, minimizing disruptions to productivity.

Quality Improvement: By reorganizing work processes based on predicted absenteeism, the organization can enhance the quality of work generated.
